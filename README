Some tools I need to port Lush to Clojure for the java interop capabilities (since my broker and
data sources are Java related).

It's done in the style of Lush, and at present is mostly syntax sugar for JBLAS calls

TBD soon: regression, a timeseries class, filters, and eventually a KNN learner and
optimization tools.

Incanter didn't serve my needs, as Colt is a pretty lousy linear algebra library, and
there is a lot of stuff in Incanter I either don't need, can't make work with Clojure
1.3 or don't agree with.

If it's at all useful to anyone, by all means, use it, branch it, sell it; I don't care.
